## ðŸ’¬ About Me

Hello there, my name is Tim and I am a full stack web developer from Orange County. I am a goal oriented person who decided to pursue my passion in the web development industry. Web development is the right path for me since I am a very creative minded person. Being able to design things and see the results of what you build in real time is extremely rewarding. Web development challenges me in a fulfilling way by driving me to constantly learn new skills and techniques.
